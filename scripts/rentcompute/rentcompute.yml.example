# RentCompute Provisioning Configuration Example
# Use this template to create your own .rentcompute.yml file

# Instance provisioning configuration
provisioning:
  # Type of provisioning to use (ansible, script, or docker)
  type: ansible
  
  # Ansible provisioning configuration
  playbook: ./playbook.yml
  # Optional: Root directory where Ansible playbooks and related files are located
  # Can be absolute or relative path (relative to current directory)
  # Example: ~/workspace/project/ansible or ../scripts/localnet
  root_dir: ../localnet
  # Optional: Target hosts group for inventory (default: rentcompute)
  # Should match the hosts: line in your playbook
  hosts_group: localnet
  # Optional: Path to a vars file (relative to root_dir if specified, or current directory)
  # This will be used with the --extra-vars @file.yml argument
  vars_file: group_vars/all/vault.yml
  # Extra variables to pass directly to ansible-playbook
  extra_vars:
    app_env: development
    gpu_driver: nvidia-latest
  
  # For script provisioning (uncomment to use):
  # type: script
  # script: ./setup.sh
  
  # For docker provisioning (uncomment to use):
  # type: docker
  # compose_file: ./docker-compose.yml

# Optional environment variables to set on the instance
environment:
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: "0,1"
  TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH: "true"

# Directories to sync with the instance using the rsync command
# These will be synced when running: rentcompute rsync
sync:
  - source: ./data
    destination: ~/data
  - source: ./src
    destination: ~/project/src
  - source: ./scripts
    destination: ~/scripts

# Configuration for reloading instances after changes
# This is used by the reload command and by rsync --reload

  type: ansible
  
  # Ansible reload configuration
  playbook: ./reload.yml
  # Root directory where Ansible files are located
  root_dir: ../localnet

  # Optional path to vars file (relative to root_dir)
  vars_file: group_vars/all/vault.yml
  # Extra variables for ansible-playbook
  extra_vars:
    remote_mode: true
